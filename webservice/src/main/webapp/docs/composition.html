<H1>Chart Composition</H1>

<p>
    Chart Composition actions are those that take two charts and combine them to make a single one.
    The model for how they work is:
</p>

<P><b>
    (actions defining chart A) + (actions defining chart B)
</b></P>
<p>
    In the grammar, though, the parentheses are not required, or even allowed.
    The three composition methods are <code>tile</code>, <code>overlay</code> and <code>nest</code>
</p>
<p>
    Composition is a work in progress. Currently <code>tile</code> and <code>overlay</code> work, but
    <code>nest</code> does not work. Instead the nested element is ignored.
</p><p>
    The composition commands have a defined precedence:
    <code>nest</code> binds tightest, and <code>tile</code> weakest. Thus
    <code>A | B + C &lt; D | E</code> will result in three charts: "A", "B + C &lt; D" and "E".
    The middle chart will have one element "B" and the second element "C" will have element "D" nested within it.
</p>


<h3><code>|</code> (tile)</h3>
This is the simplest form of composition. It tiles the available space and puts the charts into the space.
The default layout can be changed by giving each chart an
<code>at</code> action to indicate its location (in percentages: left, top, right, bottom)
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(region) y(income) mean(income) | bar x(region)
    y(violent_crimes) mean(violent_crimes)</a>
    <br/><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(density) y(income) at(0,0,100,100) color(region) | polar stack bar
        y(#count) color(region) at (60,45,100, 90) legends(none)</a>
</p>

<h3><code>+</code> (overlay)</h3>
<p>
    This method of composition attempts to combine the coordinate systems of the charts, placing one on top of the other
    and having them share axes.
    Because both charts contribute to the same coordinate space, it is important to ensure that those coordinates are
    compatible.
    Below are some examples showing how this works
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(region) y(water) mean(water) + line x(region) y(under_18)
    mean(under_18) label("% under 18")</a></p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(region) yrange(income) range(income) + bar x(region)
    yrange(income) iqr(income) + point x(region) y(income) median(income) style("fill:white")</a></p>

<h3><code>&gt;</code> (nest)</h3>
<P>
    This method of composition places one chart inside the other. To do this the two charts must have a hierarchical
    nature --
    the first chart should represent an aggregation of the second, so the nesting makes sense.
    When that is defined, the second chart will be replicated as small multiples within the other chart.
</P>
