<H1>Introduction to Brunel</H1>

<p>
    The Brunel project defines a highly succinct and novel language that defines interactive data visualizations
    based on tabular data. The language is well suited for both data scientists and more aggressive business users.
    The system interprets the language and produces visualizations using the user's choice of existing lower-level
    visualization technologies typically used by application engineers such as RAVE or D3.
</p><p>
    The goal of Brunel is to be as easy as possible to integrate into an existing solution. It can be set up as a
    service (web or local) easily, and delivers results that can directly be added to web pages. The D3 driver, for
    example, produces javascript and CSS that can are placed directly into web pages with no additional steps needed.

    In addition the service oriented nature makes other delivery mechanisms simple; Jupyter notebooks (formerly
    iPython) allow access to Brunel from <i>Python</i>, <i>R</i> and a variety of other languages. We will be adding
    more delivery mechanisms as the project progresses -- in general it doesn't take more than a few days.
</p>

<H3>Language Basics</H3>
<p>
    The Brunel language consists of a list of commands. These commands each control an aspect of the chart.
    In general the order of the actions is not important, but note:
<ul>
    <li> Some actions set properties like the coordinate system, but in case of conflict, the last one wins</li>
    <li> Some actions can be applied to multiple targets -- <code>bin(a,b)</code> is the same as <code>bin(a)
        bin(b)</code></li>
    <li> The order can be important for actions that take lists of fields (for example the <code>x</code> and
        <code>y</code> commands)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Brunel commands work on a single "element" within a single chart -- in other words they work on a single
    graphical representation. To combine "elements", we use the composition operators which join together
    different elements. These operators allow side-by-side charts, overlaid elements and nested elements.

<H3>How This Guide is Organized</H3>
<p>
    This document is available both as a simple file, and also as an online guide. The online version allows
    you to click on the Brunel examples and see them in operation on a sample data set. You can also edit the
    commands and hit return to modify the syntax.
