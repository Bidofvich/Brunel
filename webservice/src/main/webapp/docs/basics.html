<h3>Data statement: <code>data('...')</code></h3>
<p>
    Although some applications may allow you to specify a data set to use through their user interface (or is
    predefined, like the example data set used in this guide),
    the data statement allows you to specify a web location to read data for an element. A different data set can
    be associated with each element, and we allow two custom location schemes as helpful utilities.
    Data is inherited from the previous element in the Brunel command chain, until a data satement for an element
    re-defines it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>sample:???.csv</code> -- using this scheme directly accesses Brunel's sample data files, one of
        AirlineDelays.csv,
        BGG Top 2000 Games.csv,
        BigTenWins.csv,
        Conferences.csv,
        minard.csv,
        minard-cities.csv,
        minard-temp.csv,
        minard-troops.csv,
        US States.csv,
        whiskey.csv.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>refresh://???</code> Brunel caches data by URL, so as to speed up multiple accesses. Although this is
        almost always a good thing, it is not for streaming data, or if you have just edited some online data!
        Simply replace the <code>http:</code> prefix for your data with <code>refresh:</code> and the resource will
        be read every time the command is executed.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data("http://brunel.mybluemix.net/sample_data/minard-troops.csv") x(long) y(lat) size(survivors:600%)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data('sample:minard-troops.csv') path x(long) y(lat) color(direction) size(survivors:600%) split(group)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data('sample:minard-troops.csv') path x(long) y(lat) color(direction) size(survivors:600%) split(group) + data('sample:minard-cities.csv') text x(long) y(lat) label(city)</a></p>

<h3>Position Commands: <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></h3>
<p>
    The commands <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> set fields to be used for the x and y dimensions. These
    dimensions may be physically flipped by using the transpose option, but that does not affect how they behave.
    Elements <em>line</em>, <em>bar</em> and <em>area</em> go along the x axis, and are intended to show how the
    'y' field depends on the 'x' field. The Y field is considered as the "result" or "dependent" field and
    generally is thought of as the more important -- it's a rare chart that doesn't specify 'Y'.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter) y(summer)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">x(winter)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">y(summer)</a>
</p>

<p>
    Diagram charts also use the position commands to specify how they are drawn; often they are defined as regular
    charts with the simple addition of a diagram keyword.
</p>

<h3>Basic Elements</h3>
<p>
    The language allows you to specify any of the following element types, which define the base way the data is
    displayed.
</p>
<pre>  point, bar, text,            line, area, path, polygon</pre>
<p>
    The most important thing to note about the element is whether it is an <b>aggregating</b> element. The first
    three elements (<em>point</em>, <em>bar</em> and <em>text</em>) are not, and they generate one symbol per row of
    data. The second group of four elements create a single graphic shape from
    all the data, and so some care is needed when applying <b>color</b>, <b>label</b> or other aesthetics as must ensure
    the value of that field is the same for the whole graphic shape. If the aesthetic field is a categorical one,
    then Brunel handles that for you automatically by splitting up the shape and making one graphic shape per group.
</p>
<p>
    if you do not specify an element, then the <code>point</code> element is the default. However a <b>diagram</b>
    knows which element it likes, and so will provide a suitable default. In general it is simplest not to define
    the element when using a diagram

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">point x(winter) y(summer) color(region) legends(none)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(winter) y(summer) color(region) legends(none)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">bar x(winter) y(summer)  bin(winter) mean(summer)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">text x(winter) y(summer) label(state) color(region) legends(none)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">text x(winter) y(summer) label(state:2) color(region) legends(none) tooltip(state)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">line x(winter) y(summer) color(region) legends(none)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">line x(winter) y(summer) color(region) using(interpolate) legends(none)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">area x(winter) y(#count)  bin(winter) stack color(region)</a>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">path x(winter) y(summer)</a>
