#title          Bubble chart of 2000 games
#description    A simple bubble chart showing the top ranked games.
                The color shows the BGG rating and the size of each bubble represents the number of
                voters for that game. The data is already sorted by rank, so no sort was needed.
                Data is from March 2015.

                for any game in that category.
