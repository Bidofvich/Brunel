<H1>Maps</H1>

<p>
    Brunel maps provide geographic features that can be referenced by the name of the geography.  The geography to display is chosen automatically based on the
    requested content including a suitable map projection. <P>

    The region and name data that back the map feature are courtesy of the public domain data sets found in the Natural Earth repository (Free vector
    and raster map data @ naturalearthdata.com).<P>

    <code>map</code> can match a geographic location either to the values in a field or to named geographic regions.  Named
    geographic locations are supplied directly to the <code>map</code> action.  Geographic matches based on the contents of a field (like names of US states)
    are done by providing the field name containing the geographic names to <code>x</code>.  Labels that are specific to the chosen geography can be requested
    using the <code>labels</code> parameter on <code>map</code>; whereas labels that are present in the data can use the <code>label</code> action with
    the data field containing the labels.<P>

    Additional overlays (<code>+</code>) can be provided using longitude and latitude values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</p>

<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map('usa', 'canada')</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map x(state) color(income)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map x(state) color(income) label(state)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map x(state) color(income) + map(labels:10)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">map ('usa') + data("sample:airports2008na.csv") x(Long) y(Lat)</a></p>


<H1>Networks</H1>
<p>
    A graph network can be specified by overlaying (<code>+</code>) <code>edge</code> and <code>network</code>.<p>
</p><p>
    Networks require one data source for the nodes and a separate data source for the connections.  The nodes data should contain unique
    identifiers for each node and the edges data should contain two fields that define which nodes are connected to each other.
</p><p>
    When specifying a network you specify the nodes and edges as two different elements, overlaid using the <code>+</code> operator.
    Note that the order of the elements determines drawing order as usual, but it is legal to specify the network element first or
    the edge (links) element first.
</p><p>
    For the node element, this is drawn as a point element (the type of the element is ignored, if specified) and can have all the usual
    aesthetics such as color, size, labels. It must have <code>key(...)</code> statement that defines one field as the key identifier
    that uniquely determines the node. The edge element must have two keys, a "from" and a "to" field which are used to search for the node
    with the same key and attach the ends to. If either a "from" or "to" identifier is not found in the node identifiers, then the edge is
    silently dropped from the display.
</p><p>
    An optional numeric parameter to <code>network</code> controls the balance between attractive and repulsive forces in the layout;
    when the value is higher than unity, nodes are forced further apart; lower than unity and they are more clustered.
</p><p>
    Networks have two interactions defined by default, panning and zooming and the ability to drag nodes around. When nodes are dragged
    the graph will modify the layout to adapt to the new configuration.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data('sample:LesMis-Connections.csv') edge key(A, B)  + data('sample:LesMis-Characters.csv')  network key(ID)  color(Main) label(Name:3) style("label-location:bottom") tooltip(name)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data('sample:LesMis-Connections.csv') edge key(A, B)  + data('sample:LesMis-Characters.csv')  network(1.5) key(ID)  color(Main) label(Name:3) style("label-location:bottom") tooltip(name)</a></p>

<H1>Trees</H1>
<p>
    A tree assumes the data has a hierarchical structure (much like a bubble chart or a treemap) and so can be used whenever the data
    support that structure. Thus we can take a hierarchical display such as a treemap and simply change the diagram from
    <code>treemap</code> to <code>tree</code> to get the desired tree. In this formulation, the levels for the tree are the levels
    of the fields used in the position coordinates; only the leaf nodes are "real" nodes which can be colored, labeled etc.
    The internal nodes are simply categories in data, and so cannot be modified away from their default view.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data("sample:US States.csv") treemap x(region, presidential_choice) color(income) mean(income) size(population) sum(population)</a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data("sample:US States.csv") tree x(region, presidential_choice) color(income) mean(income) size(population) sum(population)</a></p>

<p>
    Alternatively, a tree can be defined with two data sets for nodes and links, exactly like a network. If the data is not actually
    a tree, extra nodes are dropped to make it so. Thus the example for a network above can be directly changed to be a tree,
    although the resulting display makes little sense -- trees should be reserved for hierarchical data.
</p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data('sample:LesMis-Connections.csv') edge key(A, B)  + data('sample:LesMis-Characters.csv')  tree key(ID)  color(Main) label(Name:3) style("label-location:bottom") tooltip(name) </a></p>
<p class="examples"><a onClick="showAction(this.text)">data("sample:US States.csv") tree x(region, presidential_choice) color(income) mean(income) size(population) sum(population)</a></p>
<p>
    For trees, the default interactivity is pan and zoom as usual, but we also add the ability to double-click on a node to hide
    or unhide the subtree coming out of it.
</p>
