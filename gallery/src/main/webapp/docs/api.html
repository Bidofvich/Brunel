<H1>API for programmatic extension</H1>

<p>
    Although most users of Brunel will have sufficent tools with the syntax, we provide a number of
    extension points to allow more to be done. This section documents those APIs
</p>


<H3>Mouse Events</H3>
<p>
    The <code>interaction(call:functionName:eventName)</code> command adds a handler for the element that processes
    the given mouse event. When the named event occurs on the element, then the given function is called.
    Events supported are <code>click, mouseover, mousemove and mouseout</code>. We also support the special event <code>snap</code>
    as described in the section on interactivity. It is a <code>mousemove</code> event that snaps to the nearest data
    item.
</p>
<p>
    When the function is called, it is passed the following parameters:
</p>
<ul>
    <b>item</b> -- the data item for this item; a structure with a number of fields as detailed below.
    <b>target</b> -- the raw SVG item targeted by this event.
    <b>element</b> -- a structure describing the element that was interacted with, detailed below.
</ul>


<H3>Item</H3>
<p>
    The `item` contains a set of fields used to define the target of the event. They include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>row</b> -- A row of the processed table that was used to make this element. For a simple chart
        such as a scatterplot, that is the same as the row in the original data passed in. For an aggregated table,
        or for the data froma diagram like a treemap or chord chart, it might not be so. It is also possible for this
        to be null, if a non-data item was selected (such as an interior node in a bubble chart).
    </li>

    <li><b>key</b> -- Most elements define a key. This is a value or set of values that identifies the data items
        as being the same for the purposes of updates (including filters and animation). It can be a useful
        name for the item, or a debugging hint.
    </li>

    <li><b>points</b> -- only defined for shapes like paths and lines, where the shape consists of multiple data points,
        this is an array of objects with fields <code>{x, y, d}</code>. The `x` and `y` members give the pixel
        coordinates of each
        constituent point, and the `d` member gives an `item` for that point (with its own `row` and `key`)
    </li>

</ul>

<H3>Element</H3>
<p>
    The <code>element</code> contains a set of member fields and functions for working with the visualization. They
    include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>chart()</b> -- Returns a structure for the parent chart (see below)</li>

    <li><b>data()</b> -- Returns the processed Data object (summarized , etc.)</li>

    <li><b>original()</b> -- Returns the original Data object before any transformations were performed on it</li>

    <li><b>selection()</b> -- Returns the d3 selection that defines the data marks</li>

    <li><b>group()</b> -- The SVG group containing the element. This is where you would add custom decorations or items</li>

    <li><b>fields</b> -- A structure containing sub-fields that define the names of fields that were used in the chart
        (such as <code>x, y, color</code> and <code>key</code>). Each of these is an array, even if only of size one
    </li>

</ul>


<H3>Chart</H3>
<p>
    The <code>chart</code> contains a set of member fields and functions for working with the visualization. They
    include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>elements</b> -- An array of elements contained in the chart (see above)</li>

    <li><b>scales</b> -- If defined, gives the coordinate scales as a structure `{x, y}`. These are standard d3
        scales, configured by Brunel.
    </li>

    <li><b>zoom(params, time)</b> -- A function that, if called with no parameters, will return the zoom
        transform for the chart. It can be passe the same type of object to set the current transform,
        with an optional time parameter which indicates the time in milliseconds the zoom should be animated.
        The zoom trasnform is a <code>d3.zoomTransform</code>code> described in
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoomTransform">https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoomTransform</a>.
        It has methods like <code>scale</code> and <code>translate</code> that craete new modified transforms.
        For example, to reset the zoom on the first chart and then scale by a factor of two, use this:
        <code>vis.charts[0].zoom(d3.zoomIdentity.scale(2))</code>
    </li>


</ul>

<H2>Examples of Use</H2>
<p>
    Here are some code fragments suitable for use in a callback showing how to use the information passed in:
</p>

<H4>Checking Parameters</H4>
<pre>
    var scales = element.chart().scales;
    if (!scales || !scales.x || !scales.y || !item.row) return;
</pre>
<p>
    The above code is a simple guard that means nothing will happen if we don't have both data and scales
</p>

<H4>Finding data and pixel coordinates</H4>
<pre>
    var mouse = d3.mouse(target), x = mouse[0], y = mouse[1];           // Mouse pixel coordinates
    var dataX = scales.x.invert(x);                                     // The X coordinate as a data value
    var extent = scales.x.range(), minX = extent[0],                    // pixel ranges for the x dimension
        maxX = extent[extent.length-1];
</pre>

<p>
    These give examples of using coordinates and scales. Note that some scales (like ones for categorical data)
    are not invertible in d3, so this may fail.
</p>

<H4>Finding Brunel fields and data values</H4>
<pre>
    var xField = element.data().field(element.fields.x[0]);             // Getting the field for the x axis
    var formattedText = xField.format(dataX);                           // Human-readable value for x
</pre>

<p>
    The Dataset <code>element.data()</code> and the Field object have a lot of power and many attributes.
    They have the same calls in JavaScript as in Java, so you can look up th Java docs to see their usage.
</p>

<H4>Adding your own elements</H4>
<pre>
    var circle = element.group().selectAll("circle.MyClass");           // Find the circle I created
    if (g.empty())                                                      // Make it if necessary
        circle = element.group().append("circle").attr("class", "MyClass");
    g.attr("r", 20).attr('x', x).attr(y, y);                            // Use d3 to set the attributes
</pre>

<p>
    The above example places a circle where the mouse is, using d3
</p>

<H4>Adding your own elements, alternative version</H4>
<pre>
    var circle = element.group().selectAll("circle.MyClass");           // Find the circle I created
    if (g.empty())                                                      // Make it if necessary
        circle = element.group().append("circle").attr("class", "MyClass");
    var box = target.getBBox();                                         // SVG call for target's bounds
    var cx = box.x + box.width/2, cy = box.y + box.height/2,            // get box center and radius around it
        r = Math.max(box.width, box.height)/2;
    g.attr('r', r).attr('x', cx).attr(y, cy);                            // Use d3 to set the attributesX
</pre>

<p>
    The above example places a circle around the target of the mouse event
</p>


<H4>Programmatic control of pan and zoom</H4>
<pre>
    var v = new BrunelVis('visualization');
    v.build(table1);

    function panBy(amount) {
	    var z = v.charts[0].zoom();
	    v.charts[0].zoom( { dx: z.dx+amount }, 3000);
    }

    /// ....

    &lt;button type="button" onclick="panBy(-50)"&gt;LEFT&lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;button type="button" onclick="panBy(50)"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/button&gt;

</pre>

<p>
The above code fragment calls the chart's zoom method first to get the current values, and then to update and
set them, with a very slow animation speed.
</p>
